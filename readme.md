## Overall Description

### Product Perspective
"The Peppy Post" is an independent product designed to aggregate news from various sources and present it to users based on their selected interests.

### Product Functions
- Dynamic news category selection
- Personalized news feed generation
- Article bookmarking for future reference

### User Classes and Characteristics
- Casual Readers: Users looking for a quick update on various topics.
- Research Users: Users who require in-depth articles for research purposes.

### Operating Environment
"The Peppy Post" will operate across all modern web browsers on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## System Features

### Home Page View
The home page serves as the entry point to the application, inviting users to begin their reading experience.

### News Category Selection
Users can select categories from a predefined list, which will influence the news articles that are displayed to them.

### News Display
News articles are displayed in a user-friendly format, allowing for easy reading and navigation between different news sections.

### Bookmarking
Articles can be bookmarked, with bookmarks being saved in the user's local browser storage for persistence.

(And the document would continue to elaborate on each section as needed, ensuring a thorough coverage of the system requirements and project documentation.)

The full document would include detailed descriptions of each feature, user interface design, and interaction with backend services (if applicable). It would also contain information on error handling, security considerations, and any APIs used by the application. The goal of the SRS is to ensure that the project's scope, features, and constraints are well-documented and understood by all stakeholders involved.
